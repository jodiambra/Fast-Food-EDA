## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis on american fast food chains, and compare those that are doing well, with those that are struggling. 

## Conclusions
We see that McDonald's is by far the best selling fast food chain, followed by Starbucks and Chick-Fil-A. McDonald's makes up 15.8% of the total market share of these 50 fast food chains, while the second highest, Starbucks,  makes up 9.8%. The features that are highly correlated with sales are 2021 total units, and the number of franchised stores. 

When it comes to unit sales, Chick-Fil-A makes the most, followed by Raising Cane's and Krispy Kreme. Subway has the most amount of units, and then we have Starbucks and McDonald's. Despite having the most units in 2020, Subway had the highest loss of units in 2021, while other chains had slight losses or a few hundred additions. 

We then compared the ratio of franchises to company owned units. Chains such as Raising Cane's and Panda Express had the highest ration of company owned units, while Dairy Queen and Tropical Smoothie Cafe had the highest ratio of franchises.
